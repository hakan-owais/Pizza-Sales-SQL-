# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
Author: Mohammed Owaise

**Overview** <br />
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze a pizza sales dataset. It was undertaken as a practice exercise to reinforce SQL concepts, following a guided tutorial from WS Cube Tech. Key queries and visualizations reveal sales insights, revenue patterns, and pizza performance metrics.

**Dataset**<br />
The dataset consists of four interrelated CSV files representing relational data for pizza sales:<br />
**Orders:** Contains order IDs, order dates, and times.<br />
**Order Details:** Links orders to pizzas, including pizza_id and order_id.<br />
**Pizzas:** Lists pizzas with their sizes and base prices. Links pizza_type_id to order details.<br />
**Pizza Types:** Provides metadata about pizzas, including categories and ingredients.<br />

**Key Queries**<br />
The analysis includes 13 SQL queries addressing various aspects of the dataset:
1. Total Number of Orders Placed.
2. Total Revenue Generated from Pizza Sales.
3. Most Expensive Pizza.
4. Pizza Ordered Quantity by Size.
5. Most Ordered Top 5 Pizzas.
6. Total Pizza Ordered Quantity by Category.
7. Total Orders by Hour.
8. Category-wise Distribution of Pizzas.
9. Average Pizzas Ordered per Day.
10. Top 3 Ordered Pizzas Based on Revenue.
11. Contribution of Revenue by Each Pizza Category in Percentage.
12. Cumulative Revenue Generated Over Time.
13. Category-wise Top 3 Revenue-Generated Pizzas.
   
**Key Learnings**<br />
Improved SQL proficiency, including advanced JOINs, aggregations, and filtering.
Developed a structured approach to solving business problems using SQL.
Gained hands-on experience with real-world relational datasets.

**Conclusion**<br />
This project showcased SQL's power in deriving actionable insights from structured data, including sales performance, revenue distribution, and operational efficiency. It reinforces the importance of SQL in 
business analytics.
